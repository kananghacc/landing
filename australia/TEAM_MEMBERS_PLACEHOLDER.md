# Australia Department Team Members

## Note
The team member details mentioned in the content ("Team Members Details of Australia Department â€“ (Attached on Mail)") were not provided in the content. 

## Current Status
The landing page includes a placeholder team section with 3 generic team member cards.

## To Complete
When the actual team member details are provided, update the team section in `index.html` with:
- Actual team member names
- Photos/images
- Roles and specializations
- Contact information if needed

## Location in Code
The team section is located in the HTML file at:
```html
<!-- Team Members Section -->
<section class="py-20 bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-50 to-blue-50" aria-labelledby="team-heading">
```

Replace the placeholder team member cards with actual team information.
