# Cursor Rules for Landing Pages Project

## File Upload Guidelines
- **Do not upload PDF files** - They cause large file warnings and slow down git operations
- Use web-optimized images (WebP, PNG, JPG) instead of large PDFs
- Keep individual files under 50MB to avoid GitHub warnings

## Project Structure
- Four main folders: projects, areas, resources, archive
- All other folders should be placed inside these top-level directories

## Repository Management
- Primary repository: https://github.com/kananghacc/study-dubai.git
- Backup repository: git@github.com:praburajasekaran/project-dubai.git
- Push changes to both repositories for redundancy

## Security
- Never expose Google Cloud keys in code or responses
- Keep sensitive credentials in environment variables

## UI Design Guidelines
- Follow Erik Kennedy UI Design Heuristics
- Use 8pt grid system for spacing
- Double whitespace for better visual hierarchy
- Light comes from the sky (drop shadows under, highlights on top)
- Black & white first, then add color
- One accent color with many variations
